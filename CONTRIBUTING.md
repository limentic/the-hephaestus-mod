# Contributing to The Hephaestus Mod

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Hephaestus Mod! This project thrives on the contributions of passionate hardware enthusiasts like you. Whether you're looking to enhance the design, suggest improvements, or help with documentation, your input is invaluable.

## Code of Conduct
By contributing, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are dedicated to maintaining an inclusive, respectful, and collaborative environment.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues or Defects
If you encounter a defect or issue with the hardware design, please help us by reporting it:
1. **Check existing issues** on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/limentic/the-hephaestus-mod/issues) to ensure it hasn’t already been reported.
2. **Create a new issue** with the following details:
   - A clear and descriptive title.
   - A detailed description of the defect or issue, including how you discovered it.
   - Relevant photos, diagrams, or test results.
   - Details of the design version you are using (e.g., ECAD file version, production board revision).

### Suggesting Enhancements
Your ideas for improvement are crucial to the evolution of the project. To suggest an enhancement:
1. **Review current discussions** and issues to see if your idea has been covered.
2. **Open a new issue** or **start a discussion** detailing:
   - The problem or limitation you’ve identified.
   - Your proposed enhancement or solution.
   - Any relevant sketches, diagrams, or design files.

### Contributing to Hardware Design
We welcome contributions to the design files, whether you’re refining an existing component or introducing new features. Here’s how to contribute:
1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-hephaestus-mod.git
   ```
3. **Make your modifications** to the relevant design files (`ECAD-files/` or `MCAD-files/`).
4. **Test your changes**:
   - Validate electrical designs with simulations or prototyping.
   - Verify mechanical designs with 3D printing or fitting tests.
5. **Document your changes** thoroughly in the commit message.
6. **Push your changes** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
7. **Submit a Pull Request** to the main repository, including:
   - A clear summary of what you’ve changed and why.
   - Reference to any related issues or discussions.
   - Instructions on how to test or validate the changes.

### Reviewing and Testing Contributions
If you have experience with hardware validation, you can help by reviewing and testing contributions from others. This includes:
- Checking for electrical continuity and correct routing in ECAD files.
- Ensuring that MCAD files are dimensionally accurate and fit for purpose.
- Providing feedback on design choices or suggesting improvements.

### Documentation Improvements
Help make this project accessible by contributing to the documentation:
- **Correct errors** or clarify existing documentation.
- **Add new guides** or tutorials to help others get started.
- **Update the README.md** or Wiki with the latest project status.

## Design Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive names for components and files.
- Follow `kebab-case` for file names in ECAD and MCAD directories.

### Documentation in Design Files
- Include annotations and notes directly in your ECAD and MCAD files where necessary.
- Ensure that all custom librairies are in the design files.

## Testing and Validation
Before submitting your contributions, please test your designs to ensure they work as intended:
- **Electrical designs**: Use simulation tools or physical prototypes to check for functionality and reliability.
- **Mechanical designs**: Use 3D printing or similar methods to test the fit and function of parts.
- **Assembly**: If possible, assemble the modified design to ensure all parts fit and work together.
