## Introduction
The Hephaestus Mod is an open-source hardware modification for the Apple Magic Keyboard. This project aims create a mechanical keyboard using the Apple Magic Keyboard as a base.

## Getting Started
The Hephaestus Mod project is organized into the following directories:
- `ECAD-files/` - Contains the KiCad project files for the Hephaestus Mod.
    In this directory, you will find the following subdirectories:
    - `dev-board/` - Contains the KiCad project files for the development board. This board was used to test out if the reverse engineered keyboard matrix was correct.
    It can also be repurposed as a breakout board for the matrix connector. \
    **Be careful!** The revision 1.0 of the board contains errors for the 9, TAB and Option Right keys. I will make another revision of the dev board when I have time.
    - `prod-board/` - Contains the KiCad project files for the production board. This board is the version of the Hephaestus Mod that is intended to be used. \
    **Be careful!** For the moment this board is still not tested. It is still in manufacturing. I will update this README when I have tested it and confirmed that it works.
    - `touch-id-ribbon` - Contains the KiCad project files for the Touch ID ribbon cable. This cable is used to connect the Touch ID connector on the Apple motherboard to the production board.
- `MCAD-files/` - Contains the .STEP files of the Hephaestus Mod.
    - `hephaestus-case.step` - The case for the Hephaestus Mod.
    - `hephaestus-main-board.step` - The 3D model of the production board.
    - `magic-keyboard-battery.step` - The 3D model of the Magic Keyboard battery.
    - `magic-keyboard-motherboard.step` - The 3D model of the Magic Keyboard motherboard.
